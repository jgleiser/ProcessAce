# Contributing to ProcessAce

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to **ProcessAce**!  
This project is early-stage and evolving quickly, so even small contributions (typo fixes, ideas, issues) are valuable.

> By contributing to this repository, you agree that your contributions may be used in both the Sustainable Use edition and any future commercial editions of ProcessAce (see the “Contributions” section in `LICENSE`).

## 📌 Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** – something is broken or not working as documented.
- **Feature requests** – ideas that would make ProcessAce more useful.
- **Documentation** – improving README, examples, or inline docs.
- **Code contributions** – fixes, refactors, new features.

If you’re unsure whether something is wanted or in scope, please open an issue to discuss before investing significant time.

## 🐛 Reporting bugs

When opening a bug report, please include:

- Version/commit hash (if relevant)
- Environment (OS, Node.js version, Docker or not)
- Steps to reproduce (as minimal as possible)
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior (including logs or screenshots if helpful)

Use the **“Bug report”** issue template if available, or clearly label the issue.

## 💡 Suggesting features

Feature requests are welcome, especially if they are grounded in real process-discovery/doc needs.

Please try to include:

- Problem / pain point you’re facing
- How you currently solve it (if at all)
- What you’d expect ProcessAce to do
- Any constraints (compliance, on-prem, etc.)

This helps prioritize and design features that fit the vision of ProcessAce.

## 🔁 Pull request process

1. **Discuss first for bigger changes**  
   For non-trivial changes (new modules, architectural changes), open an issue or join an existing one to align on direction.

2. **Fork and branch**  
   - Fork the repo
   - Create a branch from `main`, e.g. `feature/bpmn-generator` or `fix/transcript-crash`

3. **Code style and structure**  
   - Follow existing code style and patterns.
   - Keep PRs focused: one logical change per PR is ideal.
   - Add or update tests when relevant.

4. **Commit messages**  
   - Use clear, descriptive commits.
   - Prefer imperative style: `Add BPMN validation`, `Fix LLM config parsing`.

5. **Open the PR**  
   - Target the `main` branch (unless otherwise documented).
   - Describe the motivation, what changed, and how to test it.
   - Reference related issues (e.g. `Closes #12`).

6. **Review and feedback**  
   - Be open to feedback and requested changes.
   - Maintainers may ask for refinements to align with architecture or roadmap.

## 🧪 Tests

As the test suite evolves, please:

- Run existing tests before submitting a PR.
- Add tests for new behavior where possible.
- Keep tests fast and deterministic.

Testing instructions (e.g. `npm test`, `npm run lint`) will be documented in the main README as they are added.
