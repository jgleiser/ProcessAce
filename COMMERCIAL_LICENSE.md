# ProcessAce Commercial / Enterprise License

> This document is an **informational summary** of the commercial / enterprise licensing model for **ProcessAce**.  
> It is **not** the actual legal contract. The final terms and conditions will be defined in a separate, signed agreement between you and the Licensor.

## 🏢 Overview

ProcessAce is made available under a **Sustainable Use License** for source-available, internal use.  
If you want to go beyond those rights – especially to run ProcessAce as a service or embed it into a commercial product – you need a **commercial / enterprise license**.

The commercial license is designed for organizations that:

- Want to offer **ProcessAce as a hosted service** (SaaS, multi-tenant platform, or part of an automation suite).
- Want to **embed ProcessAce** into their own commercial software stack or product.
- Need **enterprise features and support**, such as advanced auth, compliance, SLAs, or guaranteed response times.

## 📜 What the commercial license typically allows

Exact rights depend on the signed contract, but a commercial / enterprise license will generally allow you to:

- **Operate ProcessAce as a hosted service**  
  - Run multi-tenant or white-label instances for multiple customers.
  - Offer ProcessAce-based features as part of your SaaS or product.

- **Embed ProcessAce into commercial products**  
  - Integrate ProcessAce deeply into your own platform.
  - Distribute ProcessAce as a component of your proprietary solution.

- **Customize without Sustainable Use restrictions**  
  - Maintain private forks and customizations without being bound by the Sustainable Use License’s SaaS/redistribution limits (subject to contract).

- **Access enterprise features and services** (if included in your plan)  
  - Priority support and incident response.
  - SLAs for uptime/response time.
  - Advanced security & compliance options.
  - Guidance on architecture, scaling, and best practices.

## 🔒 Relation to the Sustainable Use License

The **ProcessAce Sustainable Use License** (see `LICENSE`) applies to the public repository and community edition.

A **commercial / enterprise license**:

- Does **not** replace the Sustainable Use License for the public code.
- Grants **additional rights** and exceptions for your organization, as defined in the signed contract.
- May cover:
  - Additional proprietary modules or enterprise-only features.
  - Specific deployment rights (e.g. multi-tenant SaaS).
  - Support and service obligations from the Licensor.

If there is any conflict between this summary and the signed commercial agreement, the **signed commercial agreement** will prevail.

## ✅ Typical use cases for a commercial license

You likely need a commercial license if you:

- Want to offer “ProcessAce-as-a-Service” to multiple customers.
- Are building an automation or process-mining platform and want ProcessAce as a core engine.
- Are an ISV or SaaS vendor embedding ProcessAce in your commercial product.
- Require contractual guarantees (SLAs, support, maintenance commitments).

You likely **do not** need a commercial license if you:

- Use ProcessAce **internally** within your company for your own processes.
- Host a **single-tenant instance for a specific client** as part of a consulting or integration project (provided you comply with the Sustainable Use License terms).
- Experiment, prototype, or contribute improvements in a non-SaaS context.

For precise interpretation, always refer to the full Sustainable Use License and your legal counsel.
